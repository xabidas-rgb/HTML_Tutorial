<!--1. HTML Elements 
       An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content and an end tag.
        Syntax - <tagName> Content goes here </tagName>
                 eg - <h1> My First Heading </h1>
                      <p> My First Paragraph </p>

        Note - Some HTML elements have no content (like the <br> element). These element are called 
               "Empty Elements". "Empty Elements" donot have end tag.

     2. Nested HTML Elements
        HTML elements can be nested.(This means that elements can contain other elements)
        All HTML Elements consist of nested HTML elements.
        Explanation - As we can see from the above example, <html> element is the root element and it defines the whole 
        HTML document. It has a start tag <html> and an end tag </html>. Then inside the <html> element there is a <body>
        element. The <body> element defines the document's body. It has a start tag <body> and an end tag </body>. Then, inside
        the <body> element there are 2 other elements: <h1> and <p>
            The <h1> element defines a heading. It has a start tag <h1> and an end tag </h1>
            Simillarly, the <p> element defines a paragraph. It has a start tag <p> and an end tag </p>

     3. Never Skip the End Tag
        Some HTML elements will display correctly, even if you forget the end tag.
        Eg - <p> This is the First Paragraph
        Note - But it is recommeneded never to rely on this as some unexpected errors or exceptions might occur 
               in browser.

     4. Empty HTML elements
        HTML elements with no content are called empty elements.
        The <br> tag defines a line break, and is an empty element without a closing tag.

     5. HTML is Not Case Sensitive
        HTML tags are not Case Sensitive: <P> means the same as <p>
        The HTML standard does not require lower-case tags, but it is recommended to use lowercase in HTML, and 
        demands for stricter document types like XHTML.
